 * at startup so the agent can load them natively in every project — web,
 * desktop, and the Discord bridge all discover them through the same
 * skill-discovery paths OpenCode itself scans.

 * frontmatter and is refreshed on every server start (content is regenerated
 * with the current local API base URL). A skill file WITHOUT that marker is
 * user-owned and is never touched — users who want to customize a system
 * skill can simply remove the marker to take ownership.
